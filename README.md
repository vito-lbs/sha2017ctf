# sha 2017 ctf

hi, i played in the sha-2017 ctf run by eindbazen and had a lot of fun and want
you to have fun playing in ctfs too

i came in 119th place with 800 points, and solved some classes of challenge i'd
never really touched before

## challenges i solved

| Challenge | Solved | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WannaFly (Forensics) | #162, 1 day, 4 hours after release (2017-08-06 14:50:03) | 100 |
| Compromised? (Forensics) | #129, 1 day, 2 hours after release (2017-08-06 12:46:37) | 100 |
| Malware Testrun (Network) | #43, 7 hours, 51 minutes after release (2017-08-05 17:51:29) | 200 |
| Vod Kanockers (Network) | #93, 7 hours, 4 minutes after release (2017-08-05 17:04:55) | 100 |
| Stack Overflow (Crypto) | #47, 4 hours, 50 minutes after release (2017-08-05 14:50:15) | 100 |
| asby (Binary) | #23, 1 hour, 15 minutes after release (2017-08-05 11:15:04) | 100 |
| Bon App√©tit (Web) | Third to solve this challenge! 13 minutes, 2 seconds after release (2017-08-05 10:13:02) | 100 |

If you see a directory for a challenge that's not one of those, it was either
for the junior CTF (which was a good thing to have!) or a challenge I struggled
with and never did solve.

## thanks

Serious thanks for Eindbazen running a great game; I know these aren't quick or
easy to put together, and this one was very well ran! Also thanks to the other
players, both irl at sha-2017 and playing remotely.
